# CQRS

**Commands** : includes operation request/response models changing data resource like create, update delete.<br/>
**Query** : includes operation request/response models querying data resource.<br/>
**Handlers** : includes operations itself like CRUD or business.<br/>
**Events** :  Events catch the events like productCreated, productUpdated or productDeleted and take action depending on event.<br/>

For managing relations and business case flows MediatR was used
